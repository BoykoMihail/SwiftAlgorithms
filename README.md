## Overview

Welcome to SwiftAlgorithms! This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Swift.

## Algorithms

### Easy
1. [Two Sum](./Easy/Two%20Sum)
   - Description: Find two numbers in an array that sum up to a specific target.
   - Implementation: [Two Sum](./Easy/Two%20Sum/TwoSum.swift)

### Medium
1. [Add Two Numbers (Linked Lists)](./Medium/Add%20Two%20Numbers)
   - Description: Add two numbers represented by linked lists.
   - Implementation: [Add Two Numbers](./Medium/Add%20Two%20Numbers/AddTwoNumbers.swift)
2. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./Medium/Longest%20Substring%20Without%20Repeating%20Characters)
   - Description: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
   - Implementation: [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./Medium/Longest%20Substring%20Without%20Repeating%20Characters/LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.swift)
3. [Longest Palindromic Substrings](./Medium/Longest%20Palindromic%20Substring)
   - Description: Return the longest palindromic substring in sring.
   - Implementation: [Longest Palindromic Substrin](./Medium/Longest%20Palindromic%20Substring/LongestPalindromicSubstrin.swift) 
4. [Zigzag Conversion](./Medium/Zigzag%20Conversion)
   - Description: The string is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows. Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion.
   - Implementation: [Zigzag Conversion](./Medium/Zigzag%20Conversion/ZigzagConversion.swift) 
5. [Reverse Integer](./Medium/Reverse%20Integer)
   - Description: Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed.
   - Implementation: [Reverse Integer](./Medium/Reverse%20Integer/ReverseInteger.swift) 
6. [String to Integer (atoi)](./Medium/String%20to%20Integer%20(atoi))
   - Description: Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
   - Implementation: [String to Integer (atoi)](./Medium/String%20to%20Integer%20(atoi)/Atoi.swift) 

### Hard
1. [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](./Hard/Median%20of%20Two%20Sorted%20Arrays)
   - Description: Find the median of the two sorted arrays.
   - Implementation: [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](././Hard/Median%20of%20Two%20Sorted%20Arrays/MedianofTwoSortedArrays.swift)
