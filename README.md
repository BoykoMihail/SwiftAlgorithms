## Overview

Welcome to SwiftAlgorithms! This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Swift.

## Algorithms

### Easy
1. [Two Sum](./Easy/Two%20Sum)
   - Description: Find two numbers in an array that sum up to a specific target.
   - Implementation: [Two Sum](./Easy/Two%20Sum/TwoSum.swift)

### Medium
1. [Add Two Numbers (Linked Lists)](./Medium/Add%20Two%20Numbers)
   - Description: Add two numbers represented by linked lists.
   - Implementation: [Add Two Numbers](./Medium/Add%20Two%20Numbers/AddTwoNumbers.swift)
2. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./Medium/Longest%20Substring%20Without%20Repeating%20Characters)
   - Description: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
   - Implementation: [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./Medium/Longest%20Substring%20Without%20Repeating%20Characters/LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.swift)
3. [Longest Palindromic Substrings](./Medium/Longest%20Palindromic%20Substring)
   - Description: Return the longest palindromic substring in sring.
